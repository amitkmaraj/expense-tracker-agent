I want to implement the recurring expenses feature described in @docs/prd-recurring-expenses.md

Please:
1. Review the PRD and existing code structure in @PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
2. Follow the coding standards in @GEMINI.md
3. Extend expense_agent/agent.py with the new recurring expense tools
4. Update the data model following our patterns
5. Include proper error handling and type hints

Generate the updated expense_agent.py with the new functionality. @llms-full.txt
