I want to build an expense tracking agent using ADK. The agent should be able to:

- Add expenses with amount, category, and description.
- For the agent model, always use gemini-2.5-flash

This plan should follow ADK best practices, incluing:

- All necessary imports
- It should create an ADK agent that can be run using adk web for testing.
- Use uv for package management, create a new uv project, and add all the relevant dependencies
- Tool functions with proper type hints and docstrings
- Agent configuration with tools


Create a simple implementation plan using Python ADK. Don't write any code yet, just create the plan. @llms-full.txt
