## 2. File Descriptions

- **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines the project's metadata and dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: The main documentation file for the project (currently empty).
- **`uv.lock`**: A lock file generated by the `uv` package manager to ensure deterministic builds.
- **`docs/prd-recurring-expenses.md`**: A Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlining the specifications for a future feature to handle recurring expenses.
- **`expense_tracker/models.py`**: Defines the Pydantic data models for the application, specifically the `Expense` model.
- **`expense_tracker/tools.py`**: Contains the core functions for managing expenses, such as adding, calculating totals, and listing recent expenses. These functions are exposed as tools to the agent.
- **`expense_tracker/agent.py`**: Defines the main agent using the `google-adk` library. It configures the agent's instructions and integrates the tools from `tools.py`.

## 3. Key Dependencies

- **`google-adk`**: The primary dependency, which is the Google Agent Development Kit. It provides the framework for building the AI agent.
- **`pydantic`**: Used for data validation and settings management through Python type annotations. The `Expense` model is a Pydantic model.

## 4. Overall Architecture Pattern

The project follows a simple, modular architecture centered around the `google-adk` library.

- **Agent-Tool Architecture**: The core logic is structured as an **agent** that uses a set of **tools**.
  - The **agent** (`expense_tracker/agent.py`) is responsible for understanding user input and deciding which tool to use.
  - The **tools** (`expense_tracker/tools.py`) are individual Python functions that perform specific tasks (e.g., adding an expense).
- **In-Memory Database**: The application currently uses a simple in-memory list (`expenses_db` in `tools.py`) to store expenses. This is a simple approach for development but is not persistent.
- **Data Modeling**: Pydantic models (`expense_tracker/models.py`) are used to define the structure of the data, ensuring type safety and providing clear data contracts.
- **Configuration-driven**: The agent's behavior is defined by the instructions and tools provided in its configuration (`expense_tracker/agent.py`).
